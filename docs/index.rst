GWSumm: the gravitational-wave summary information system
#########################################################

The `gwsumm` package is a tool used by the `Laser Interferometer Gravitational-wave Observatory (LIGO) <http://www.ligo.org>`_ to collect, aggregate, and visually summarise the myriad data produced throughout the experiment in order to characterise instrument performance.

The output of this package, known internally as the 'summary pages', give an archive of a number of figures or merit, including time-series amplitude trends, frequency spectra and spectrograms, and transient event triggers.
