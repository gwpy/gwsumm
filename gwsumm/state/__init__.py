"""A `SummaryState` defines a sub-set of time over which a `~gwsumm.tabs.Tab`
should be processed.
Each `SummaryState` is normally tied to one or more data-quality flags marking
times during which each of the LIGO instruments was operating in a certain
configuration, or was subject to a known noise interference.

==================
The state registry
==================

GWSumm defines a state 'registry', simply a record of all `SummaryState`
objects that have been defined (and registered) so far in a given program.
The registry just makes remembering states in complicated programs a little
easier.

Any `SummaryState` can be registered with an arbitrary name as follows::

    >>> from gwsumm.state.registry import register_state
    >>> register_state(mystate, 'my state')

and can be recovered later::

    >>> from gwsumm.state.registry import get_state
    >>> mystate = get_state('my state')
